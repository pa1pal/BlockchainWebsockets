# BlockchainWebsockets
Getting Transaction data through WebSockets

# Libraries used:
- Evernote Job: 
Used to run job every 15 minutes and fetch the current BTC/USD price.
- Retrofit: 
It lets you treat API calls as simple Java method calls with annotation usage, so you only define which URLs to hit and the types of the request/response parameters as Java classes. 
- Butterknife: 
Very helpful. Omit the use of findViewById, OnItemClickListner etc
